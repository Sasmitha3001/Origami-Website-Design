<i>
There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
<br><br>
Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
<br><br>
Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.
<br><br>
Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
<br><br>
Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.

    Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.
    <br><br>
    There are around 160 species of chameleon.
    <br><br>
    Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.
    <br><br>
    Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.
    <br><br>
    Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.

<i>
A cicada is an insect of the order Hemiptera, suborder Auchenorrhyncha, in the superfamily Cicadoidea, with big eyes wide apart on the head and usually transparent, well-veined wings. There are approximately 2,500 species of cicada around the globe, and many remain unclassified. Cicadas live in temperate to tropical climates where they are one of the most widely recognized of all insects, mainly due to their large size and remarkable (and often inescapable) acoustic talents. Cicadas are sometimes called "locusts", although they are unrelated to true locusts, which are a kind of grasshopper. Cicadas are related to leafhoppers and spittlebugs.

 The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.  Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats
 <br><br>
 Like domestic cats, giant pandas have vertical slits for pupils.
 <br><br>
 Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head. 
 <br><br>
 At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb - sometimes practicing by climbing on their mum. 
 <br><br>
 They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.

    Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
    <br><br>
    Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.
    <br><br>
    Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.
    <br><br>
    Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.
    <br><br>
    Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. Both sexes take turn incubating the eggs and both feed the chicks ‘pigeon milk’ – a special secretion from the lining of the crop which both sexes produce.

    Do you know what to call a person who is too fond of or loves collecting teddy bears? – Arctophile, which combines the Greek words arctos (bear) and philos (loving/fond of).
    <br><br>
     The first toy bear is believed to be made by German toy maker Margarete Steiff in 1902 that was a jointed, stuffed one.
     <br><br>
     However, it was the 26th President of the US, Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt, who was the inspiration behind the first teddy bear.
    It was in November 1902 on a trip to Mississippi to settle a border dispute between Mississippi and Louisiana, Roosevelt refused to shoot a defenseless, black bear cub during his hunting spree.
    Political cartoonist Clifford Berryman published the incident in his cartoon that caught the attention of Brooklyn shopkeeper Morris Michtom who asked his wife Rose to make two plush stuffed toy bears with black shoe buttons for eyes.
    <br><br>
    American multi-billionaire investor Paul Greenwood owned the largest collection of teddy bears.
    In 2010, the US government auctioned his collection of 1300 teddy bears at Christie’s for £1.1 million.
    <br><br>
 Japanese company Fujitsu has manufactured a teddy bear robot for adults that can make simple gestures and even small talk with humans.
